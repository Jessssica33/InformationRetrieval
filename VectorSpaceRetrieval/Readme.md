This is a basic vector space retrieval system and use the Cranfield collection to develop and test the system. Implement an indexing scheme based on the vector space model. For the weighting scheme, use TD-IDF.

The Cranfield collection is a standard IR text collection, consisting of 1400 documents from the aerodynamics field, in SGML format.

I run my program on IntelliJ IDEA. Before running this program,  please setting command line argument. There are two arguments need to set. One is the absolute path of test files folder. For example, my test files folder is /Users/Jessica/Desktop/cranfieldDocs. Another is the count of top range files, 10, 50, 100 or 500.  Open IntelliJ IDEA, go to Run -> Edit Configurations, put the path and number to Program arguments. My program arguments looks like this: /Users/Jessica/Desktop/cranfieldDocs 10
You can change 10 to 50, 100 or 500. Then program can be run.
